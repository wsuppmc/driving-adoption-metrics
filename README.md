Step one:
.YML file: 
-	Create a YML file.
-	Set formatting for the Quarto page.
-	Specify headers, footers, and navigation bar.
-	Specify home, about, or all the navigation links.
-	Determine the placement of the navigation bar (side or top)
-	Set your home page to your main quarto page (your yml file is not your home page)

Step 2:
.qmd file:
-	Use the files we used for the links “home”  to be your main quarto page
-	If you’re making graphs and tables and need to change the directory so that you don’t get an error from the files you’re importing (this is the cause of most errors you’ll encounter)
