Accordingly, many are wondering how high the unemployment rate might be in the second quarter of 2020.\n",

Many workers, such as those in professional services, may be able to work from home and continue their activities with minimal disruption.

Therefore, I depart from the St. Louis Fed analysis by taking into account the fact that some occupations have been designated as essential and face a lower risk of layoff. Using guidance from the [Kansas Essential Functions Framework](https://governor.kansas.gov/essential-functions-guidance/), I added a field to the Famiglietti, Leibovici, and Santacreu data that indicates whether an occupation is essential.\n",

This is because my estimate assumes everyone in an \"essential\" occupation will retain his or her job, which is probably not the case. For example, restaurants need cooks and delivery drivers, but they do not need waitstaff right now. Some waiters and waitresses may assist with deliveries, which may keep their hours from getting cut, but dishwashers may end up working fewer hours as they will be washing fewer dishes. We can look at the sensitivity of the estimated unemployment rate to different assumptions in the retention rate of essential occupations. That is, maybe restaurants will only retain 50 percent of their staff instead of 100 percent as the estimate currently assumes.\n",
